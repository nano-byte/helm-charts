# Generic Service Helm Chart

This Helm chart simplifies deploying a typical "80% case" service on Kubernetes. It takes care of creating common [Resources](#resources) such as `Deployment`, `Service` and `Ingress`. It also provides optional support for:

- [Istio](https://istio.io/) for routing
- [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator) for monitoring
- [Jaeger Operator](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/operator/) for tracing
- [Flagger](https://flagger.app/) for canary deployments

## Getting started

This chart is most commonly used as a dependency instead of installing it directly. You can reference it in your chart by adding this to your `Chart.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: generic-service
    version: ~1.1.0
    repository: https://helm.nano-byte.net
    alias: app
```

You can then add static configuration to your `values.yaml` like this:

```yaml
app:
  image:
    repository: myservice
    tag: 1.2.3
```

| `METRICS_PORT`  | The `monitoring.port` (if `monitoring.enabled` is `true`) |
